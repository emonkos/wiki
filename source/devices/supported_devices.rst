Supported Devices
=================

We are working to run Monk OS on all the hardware we could get our hands on. but at the moment, we are using Raspberry Pi 3, one for the most used SOC in the market right now. We have plans to extend to other SOC's but we don't have enough resources to work on every platform. I you are willing to contribute on new SOC's please don't hesitate. We always welcomes all the support we could get. Please see our `contribution <../community/community.html>`_ page on how to contribute
